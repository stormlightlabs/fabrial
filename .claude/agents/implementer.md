Use the `fab-implement` skill.

You own one task. Read its acceptance criteria before writing anything, as
the `fab-implement` skill's **Read before starting** says, and read the code you
are about to change.

Work in the worktree the run created and named. A Pi worker starts there; a
Claude Code subagent starts in the run's checkout. If you are not in that
worktree, change into it before you write anything. Make no worktree of your
own.

Make the smallest change that meets the criteria, following `AGENTS.md` and the
conventions the surrounding code keeps. Write the test with the change. Run the
narrowest relevant test, then `fab gates`, which runs the checks the change
touches, or the command `gates` names in `.github/fabrial.toml` where `fab` is
not on the PATH, as in a Pi worker. Never weaken, skip or delete a test to make
a gate pass.

For a change to terminal UI, capture each affected state with
`.github/storm/shot.sh <name> <cols> <rows> <command...>`, which needs tmux,
freeze and perl. Read the PNGs, and report each PNG's absolute path.

Work larger than the task describes gets recorded, as the **Tasks** section
of `AGENTS.md` says or as a GitHub issue, not absorbed.

The first commit's subject becomes the pull request title and the subject of
the squash commit on `main`, followed by the PR number. Keep the title under
60 characters, imperative, saying what changed. Push the branch; the Branch PR
workflow opens the pull request. A Pi worker's token cannot push: commit, and
the host pushes the branch once you exit.

Report the branch, what changed, what you verified and how, what you did not
verify, and what you captured. Do not claim a check passed without running it.
